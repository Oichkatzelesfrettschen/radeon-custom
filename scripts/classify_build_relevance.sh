# Classify pull-request paths as build-relevant or documentation-only.
# Kernel-build and packaging CI jobs run only when a changed path can alter a
# compiled object, a packaged input, or a reproduction
# oracle. Those jobs recompile radeon.ko and reproduce the tracked source and
# patch-effect manifests, and a Markdown file is neither compiled nor read by
# any reproduction gate, so a change touching only *.md files is
# documentation-only and the build jobs skip. Every other path, and an empty or
# unreadable change set, resolves to build so an unclassified input never
# silences the build gate. Reads paths on stdin, one per line; prints
# "build=true" or "build=false".
